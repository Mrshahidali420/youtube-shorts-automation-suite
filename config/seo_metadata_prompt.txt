    <title>
        Create a concise, engaging title (under 70 characters) maximizing Click-Through Rate (CTR). Use primary keywords (GTA VI, GTA 6 trailer, Grand Theft Auto gameplay, GTA news ‚Äì prioritize MOST relevant). Incorporate emojis (üî•, üí•, üéÆ), numbers, or power words (BEST, HOT, ULTIMATE, NEW, CRAZY, EPIC) appropriately. Use numbers for lists, questions to spark curiosity, or dashes (-) for urgency. Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase. Add 2-3 relevant hashtags. Avoid blatant clickbait. {video_topic} = [insert video topic here, e.g., "GTA 6 Gameplay Leak"]
    </title>
    <description>
        Write a comprehensive, SEO-optimized description (under 4000 characters).  The VERY FIRST LINE of the description MUST be the EXACT SAME title you created in the `<title>` section above, with no modifications. Copy and paste it exactly.

        After the title, continue with engaging content using primary and secondary keywords naturally, avoiding excessive repetition. Use synonyms and related terms. The description should be engaging and well-written. Include the most important keywords within the first 150 characters. Incorporate LSI keywords organically.  Do not excessively repeat keywords.

        **MANDATORY:** Include "Credit to: {uploader_name}" and "Original Title: {original_title}".  These MUST be included.

        Include this copyright disclaimer:

        --------------„ÄêCopyright Disclaimer„Äë-------------
        All videos, songs, images, and graphics belong to their respective owners. Copyright Disclaimer under Section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976 allows for "fair use."

        Add 10-15 relevant hashtags.

        Then, add the EXACT heading "Tags Used in Video :-" followed by a list of ALL the tags you included in the `<tags>` section below. List each tag on a new line with an asterisk (*) prefix.  For example:
        * GTA 6
        * Grand Theft Auto
        * Gaming

        IMPORTANT: Every single tag from your `<tags>` section MUST be listed here, with the exact same spelling and capitalization.

        After the tags list, summarize the video's content. Highlight benefits. End with a Call to Action. Add more relevant hashtags (different from the previous list). Finally, use the heading "Ignored Hashtags :-" and add additional relevant hashtags (within the character limit). {video_topic} = [insert video topic here, e.g., "GTA 6 Gameplay Leak"] {uploader_name} = [insert uploader name here] {original_title} = [insert original title here]
    </description>
    <tags>
        Provide 25-35 SEO-optimized tags and keywords. Prioritize highly relevant keywords at the top. Use a combination of general and niche tags. Stay under 500 characters. Include keyword variations (e.g., "GTA 6", "GTA VI", "Grand Theft Auto 6"). {video_topic} = [insert video topic here, e.g., "GTA 6 Gameplay Leak"]

        IMPORTANT: Remember that ALL tags you list here MUST also appear in the "Tags Used in Video :-" section of the description.
